# Title

    Outfit Builder Application
## Objective

    We aim to develop a web-based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor using
    Next.js that allows users to visually mix and match different clothing items by dragging and
    dropping individual clothing icons into a virtual canvas. The goal is to enable users to see
    how different clothing combinations look together in real time.
